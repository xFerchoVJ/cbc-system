# README

Welcome to the "CBC" project! This is a website where users can view and sell houses in an easy and quick way.

In this GitHub repository, you will find all the source code necessary to implement this web application. Our goal is to provide a simple and efficient platform for those looking to buy or sell houses.

The website is designed intuitively so that users can search and filter houses according to their needs. Sellers can create an account and add details of their properties, including photos and detailed descriptions. Interested buyers can contact sellers directly through the website.

This project is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Rails framework to build the user interface. We also use a NoSQL database to store information about houses and users.

Thank you for visiting our project! We hope you find our website useful and enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it.

application up and running.
